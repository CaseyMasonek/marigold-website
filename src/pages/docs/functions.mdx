# Functions

Functions are defined using the `def` keyword. While every function in Marigold is technically unary, the compiler will
automatically curry your arguments, essentially creating functions of any arity.

Functions always return the last *value* of the function. While this typically refers to the last line of the function, if
statements and pipelines also act as return values.

## Usage

``def [function_name]([comma seperated arguments]) { [multiline expression] }``

## Example

<Cell code={`def add(a,b) {
    a + b;
}

putint ((add 2) 3);`} client:only={"react"} />
