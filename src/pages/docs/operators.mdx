# Operators

Operators, while breaking the pattern of `[function] [arguments]`, do tremendously increase both
readability and lightweightness. There are many operators in Marigold, some of which are unary
but most of which are binary.

## +

Addition is represented as `a + b`. This is equivalent to `ADD a b`

## -

Subtraction is represented as `a - b`. This is equivalent to `SUB a b`

## *

Multiplication is represented as `a * b`. This is equivalent to `MULT a b`

## //

Floor division is represented as `a // b`. This is equivalent to `DIV a b`

## &&

And is represented as `a && b`. This is equivalent to `AND a b`

## ||

Or is represented as `a || b`. This is equivalent to `OR a b`

## |

Pipelines are represented as `a | b;`. For more details, see [Pipelines].(/docs/pipelines)

## ==

Equalities are represented as `a == b`. This is equivalent to `EQ a b`

## !=

Inequalities are represented as `a != b`. This is equivalent to `NOT (EQ a b)`

## >

Greater than is represented as `a > b`. This is equivalent to `GT a b`

## >=

Greater than or equal is represented as `a >= b`. This is equivalent to `GTE a b`

## \<

Less than is represented as `a < b`. This is equivalent to `LT a b`

## \<=

Less than or equal is represented as `a <= b`. This is equivalent to `LTE a b`

## =

Variables are set like `[varname] = [value];`. For more details, see [Variables](/docs/variables)

## +=

`a += b` is shorthand for `a = a + b`

## -=

`a -= b` is shorthand for `a = a - b`

## *=

`a *= b` is shorthand for `a = a * b`

## //=

`a += b` is shorthand for `a = a // b`

## |=

`a |= b` is shorthand for `a = a | b`
