# Anonymous Functions/Lambdas

Lambdas are the namesake of lambda calculus, which is what Marigold is built off of. Lambdas are known as anonymous
functions because they act like regular [functions](/docs/functions) but without names. Every data type in Marigold
is secretly a lambda:

<Cell code={`putbool (0 == @fx.x);`} client:only="react" />

## Usage

A lambda is comprised of local variables and a term. You can think of a lambda like this:

`@x.x+1`

is equivalent to

`
def add(x) {
    x + 1;
}
`

## Currying

Lambdas technically only takes in one input, but Marigold will automatically curry them, meaning:

`@ab.a+b`

is just shorthand for

`@a.@b.a+b`

## Example

Lambdas are very useful when it comes to mapping and pipelines!

<Cell code={`[1,2,3,4,5] | MAP (@n.n*n) | putlist;`} client:only="react" />
