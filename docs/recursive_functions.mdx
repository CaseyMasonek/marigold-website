# Recursive Functions

In pure lambda calculus, there are no named functions. This is a problem for recursion, since in means that
functions are not able to reference themselves. Luckily, there are fixed point combinators (in our case, Z)
which can achieve a recursive effect.

## Lambda Calculus representation

`defr f(n) {...} = Z (@self.@n.{...})`

## Usage

To define a recursive function, you must use the `defr` keyword. Additionally, instead of referencing the
name of the function for the recursive call, use the `self` keyword.

## Example

[Guards](/docs/guards) work well for base cases!

<Cell code={`defr fibonacci(n) {
    # Return the nth fibonacci number #

    guard (n < 2) n;

    (self n--) + (self n - 2);
}

putint (fibonacci 10);`} client:only={"react"} />
