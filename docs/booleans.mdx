# Booleans

Booleans are the foundation of lambda calculus. They represent the values
true and false.

## true

`true` (or `TRUE` using the builtin function naming convention) is a function
that takes in two arguments, and returns the first.

### Lambda Calculus representation

`@ab.a`

## false

Similarly, `false` (or `FALSE` using the builtin function naming convention) is a function
that takes in two arguments, and returns the *second*.

### Lambda Calculus representation

`@ab.b`

(Note that this is the same a `0` and `nil`)

## Usage

The reason that booleans take in two arguments and return one of them is because that
behaviour lends itself nicely to if statements.

This means that you can set up an small conditional like this:

`[condition] [value if true] [value if false]`

This works, because if the condition is true, it will (because of its definition)
take in the two arguments and return the first, which in this case, it `[value if true]`

By the same logic, if `[condition]` is false, it will take in both `[value if true]` and
`[value if false]`, and return the second, which in this case is `[value if false]`.

## Boolean Functions

### AND

`AND` takes in two booleans, and only returns `true` if both are true. Otherwise,
it returns `false`

#### Usage

`AND [bool 1] [bool 2]`
or `[bool 1] && [bool 2]`

#### Lambda Calculus

`@ab.a b false`

### OR

`OR` takes in two booleans, and returns `true` if at least one is true. Otherwise,
it returns `false`

#### Usage

`OR [bool 1] [bool 2]`
or `[bool 1] || [bool 2]`

#### Lambda Calculus

`@ab.a true b`

### NOT

`NOT` takes in a boolean, and returns its opposite (e.g. not true == false)

#### Usage

`NOT [bool]`

#### Lambda Calculus

`@b.b false true`

### IF

`IF` takes in a condition and two value, and if the condition is true, it returns
the first. Otherwise, it returns the second.

#### Usage

`IF [condition] [value if true] [value if false]`

You may have noticed that the `IF`, is redundant here, since the same
effect can be achieved with just

`[condition] [value if true] [value if false]`

However, it does help with readability, and becomes much easier to use in [pipelines](/docs/pipelines).
If you are not using a pipeline, use the [if](/docs/if) keyword instead.

#### Lambda Calculus

`@cxy.c x y`
