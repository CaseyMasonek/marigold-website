# Pipelines

Inspired by F# and Elixir, Marigold makes heavy use of pipelines. Pipelines are great for the clean flow of data,
and help declutter large function applications. Pipes take in a value, and pass it in as the first value to a function.

## Usage

Unlike other languages, Marigold just uses `|` to denote a pipeline. So

`a | b c d` is equivalent to `b a c d`.

Often, pipes are changes.

`a | b | c` is equivalent to `c (b a)`

## Example

<Cell code={`RANGE 10
| MAP (@n.n*n)
| putlist;`} client:only={"react"} />
