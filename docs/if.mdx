# If statements

If statements are used to control the flow of logic in a script. 
It is important to note that they return a value, and thus can be
used as the return value of a function.

## Lambda Calculus representation
`
@bxy.b x y
`

## Usage

``
if ([condition]) {
    [multiline expression]
} else {
    [multiline expression]
}
``

Alternatively, either multiline expression can be replaced by a single expression.


`if ([condition]) [value] else { [multiline expression] }`

`if ([condition]) { [multiline expression] } else [value]`

`if ([condition])  [value] else [value]`

## elif

Elif (short for else if) can be used to create if statements with more than one condition.

This means that

``
if (condition1) value1 else {
 if (condition2) value2 else value3
}
``

can be shortened to

``if (condition1) value1 elif (condition2) value2 else value3``


## Example

<Cell code={`def isAdult(age) {
    if (age < 12) "kid"
    elif (age < 18) "teen"
    elif (age < 65) "adult"
    else "senior"
}

age = 16;

put (isAdult age);`} client:only={"react"} />
