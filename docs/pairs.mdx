# Pairs

Pairs are datatypes in Marigold that hold two values. They are useful for recursive functions
and folds, and are easier to use than two item lists.

## Usage

Pairs are created by putting two comma seperated items in parentheses.

`([item 1],[item 2])`

Or, using the builtin function notation:

`PAIR [item 1] [item 2]`

(This should only be used in pipelines if at all)

## Lambda Calculus representation

`@xy.@b.b x y`

Notice that it returns a function that takes in a [boolean](/docs/booleans)
and plugs the two items in the pair into the boolean. This is because true
is a function that takes in two items and returns the first, and false takes in
two items and returns the second. This means that you use booleans to index pairs.

<Cell code={`mypair = ("first","second");

# Using true to get the first item #
first = mypair true;
put first;

# Using false to get the second item #
second = mypair false;
put second;`} client:only={"react"} />

## Pair functions

### FIRST

`FIRST` takes in a pair and returns the first item. This is preferable to using
`true` to index a pair, since it's both more readable, and pipeline compatible.

#### Usage

`FIRST [pair]`

#### Lambda Calculus

`@p.p true`

### SECOND

Similarly, `SECOND` takes in a pair and returns the second item. This is preferable to using
`false` to index a pair, since it's both more readable, and pipeline compatible.

#### Usage

`SECOND [pair]`

#### Lambda Calculus

`@p.p false`
